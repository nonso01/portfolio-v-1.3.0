## Brief
> As you must have noticed, this is my portfolio's codebase, with all the assets and utilities. Am just gonna take you around showing what i learned while building it.

___
## html

```html
<h1>Hello Martin</h1>
```
> There was Nothing more comprehensible than the html markup, extremely beginner friendly and due to it simplicity , it can run(interpreted) nearly in every device from wrist watch to quantum computer. `not really :)`

- it took me roughly 3 months just to be comfortable with it `from h1 to forms`
- then css3 came into this ugly life. 

___
## css
```css
color: martingreen;
```
> css removed the ugliness of html from my sight filling my heart with fake love `actually i cheated ;)`, the cascading style sheet, was filled with up and downs but i was able to pull through making use of it `not till the core i still have to create a 3d art`

- it took roughly 5 months of padding and margins but i survived and centered a div `from display - animations`
 
- guess who appeared ?
___
## JavaScript

```js

const _= "i will confuse yoy"
console.log(_)

```
> so far learning this language, has been a blessing in my journey as a dev, it's soo dynamic and i love it, `planning to be a full stack JavaScript developer`.

- i combined css and js within my learning curve, made never made use of it until now.
- currently looking at `OOP/classes-modules/functional programming/client-side-js/server-side/three-js`
