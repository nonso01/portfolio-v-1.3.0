## portfolio-v-1.3.0 (Nonso Martin)

` Just Another Random Self-taught Dev ðŸ§¢`

#! todo started on 19/08/22
- update everything once nearly ready
- `sass --watch file this-file` to keep track of every changes


## Brief
> As you must have noticed, this is my portfolio's codebase, with all the assets and utilities. Am just gonna take you around showing you what i learned while building it.

___
## html

```html
<h1>Hello Martin</h1>
```
> There was Nothing more comprehensible than the html markup, extremely beginner friendly and due to it simplicity , it can run(interpreted) nearly in every device from wrist watch to quantum computer. `not really :)`

- it took me roughly 3 months just to be comfortable with it `from h1 to forms`
- then css3 came into this ugly life. 

___
## css
```css
color: martingreen;
```
> css removed the ugliness of html from my sight filling my heart with fake love `actually i cheated ;)`, the cascading style sheet, was filled with up and downs but i was able to pull through making use of it `not till the core i still have to create a 3d art`

- it took roughly 5 months of padding and margins but i survived and centered a div `from display - animations`
 
- guess who appeared ?
___
## JavaScript

```js

const _= "i will confuse you"
console.log(_)

```
> so far learning this language, has been a blessing in my journey as a dev, it's soo dynamic and i love it, `planning to be a full stack JavaScript developer`.

- i combined css and js within my learning curve, and never made use of it until now.
- currently looking at `OOP/classes-modules/functional programming/client-side-js/server-side/three-js`
___

## bash
```sh
echo "Hello Martin, let's destroy some servers"
```
> my story with bash is actually confusing, I don't know why i meet this guy, his really weird but he looks fruitful and powerful as well.

- my learning curve has been really slow when it came to bash, but am back for more commands 
___

### My Code structure (scripts)
![Semicolon](/assets/images/semicolon.png)

> [you can view it here](/src/scripts/main.js)

> if you take a closer look, you will notice the absence of semicolons. JavaScript will understand and read your code without any issues iff it's well structured `proper \t and \n`. semicolons are optional in JavaScript which removes extra informations from the script keeping it cleaner `actually am not clean`

- let's come back

```js

const csl=(x)=>console.log(x)
const dc=(x)=>document.createElement(x)
const dq=(x)=>document.querySelector(x)
const di=(x)=> document.getElementById(x)
const dqA=(x)=> document.querySelectorAll(x)

/*
 - i can't compare this to the almighty $(), which could allow one to see Pluto
 
 - if you find it helpful you can just try it
 
 - rather than writing 20+ lines of code filled with document.getThisAndThat()
 
 - you could easily make use of dq() or dqA() or di() with ES6 features
*/

const [e1,e2,e3,e4,e5,e6]=[dq("e1"),dq("e2"),di("e3"),dqA("e4"), etc]

/* 
rather well it's not much but, it could simplify things.
*/
```
